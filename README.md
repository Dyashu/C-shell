# Description
I have only one header file headers.h containing all necessary libraries and structs and is used in all .c files

# Assumptions

in piping along with the output of the pipe i also get the output of all the commands before pipe
3 commands which are direct keyboard inputs in Signals specification are working but i dont get prompt after that i have to start new terminal
seek doesnt work for some inputs
for inputs like sleep 2 & echo "a" only sleep runs in the background and no echo runs in foreground
